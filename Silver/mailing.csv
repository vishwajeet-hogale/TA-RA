We are developing a smartphone-based virtual agent that provides counseling to patients with Atrial Fibrillation. Atrial Fibrillation is a highly prevalent heart rhythm disorder and is known to significantly increase the risk of stroke, heart failure and death. In this project, a virtual agent is deployed in conjunction with a smartphone-based heart rhythm monitor that lets patients obtain real-time diagnostic information on the status of their atrial fibrillation and determine whether immediate action may be needed.",Timothy W.

This project aims to revolutionize these presentations using an intelligent, autonomous co-presenter agent that collaborates with the human presenter in preparing and delivering the talk. The agent will monitor the presenter's speech and gestures, audience feedback, and presentation media, dynamically choreographing these elements to maximize audience engagement and communication. The project will contribute to human-agent collaboration, artificial intelligence, computational linguistics, and human-computer interaction, advancing methods for human presenters to interact with co-presenter agents and presentation media. By amplifying presenters' abilities, the project will enhance the effectiveness of scientific presentations, potentially inspiring future generations to pursue careers in STEM fields.",Timothy W.

We are working with communities in a network of 12 churches in the Boston area, along with volunteers who provide health promotion outreach (“Health Ministry”), the church leadership, and a community liaison affiliated with a hospital, to improve the overall health of this predominately African American community. African Americans struggle significantly more with many health behaviors (e.g., smoking, physical activity) and have significantly higher rates of many chronic health conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension), compared to other racial and ethnic groups. In this effort, we are collaborating with members of the Black Ministerial Alliance of Boston and Health Ministry leaders of member churches to develop a range of sensing, monitoring, and messaging technologies to provide a smartphone-based conversational agent system that can improve health for community members. The system will empower this community of individuals to collectively solve health-relevant problems it identifies as important, such as exercise and diet promotion.",Timothy W. Bickmore,Timothy W.

Current “gold standard” performance evaluation methodologies generally rely on the use of expert assessors to judge the quality of documents or web pages retrieved by search engines, at great cost in time and expense. The advent of “crowd sourcing,” such as available through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk service, holds out the promise that these performance evaluations can be performed more rapidly and at far less cost through the use of many (though generally less skilled) “crowd workers”; however, the quality of the resulting performance evaluations generally suffer greatly. The thesis of this project is that one can obtain the best of both worlds — performance evaluations with the quality of experts but at the cost of crowd workers — by optimally leveraging both experts and crowd workers in asking the “right” assessor the “right” question at the “right” time. For example, one might ask inexpensive crowd workers what are likely to be “easy” questions while reserving what are likely to be “hard” questions for the expensive experts. While the project focuses on the performance evaluation of search engines as its use case, the techniques developed will be more broadly applicable to many domains where one wishes to efficiently and effectively harness experts and crowd workers with disparate levels of cost and expertise.",Javed Aslam,Javed Aslam,,

The project focuses on four sub-problems: (1) approximating probabilistic conjunctive queries with relational databases; (2) learning probabilities in uncertain databases based on feedback; (3) approximating exact probabilistic inference in undirected graphical models; and (4) developing a framework for learning linearized potentials from partially labeled data.,Wolfgang Gatterbauer,Dan Suciu,,

In an era of increasingly present AI, Alikhani is both enthused and wary of its transformative power. She believes in the ability of language technologies and AI to bolster critical education, health, and social justice efforts, but she also studies the ways in which they become biased. Her vision is to design inclusive and equitable language technologies that communicate effectively with diverse populations. By integrating insights from cognitive science, social sciences, and machine learning, these models can capture diversity of interpretation and benefit underserved communities.  Alikhani practices in the classroom what she preaches in her research, and strives to prepare a diverse generation of students to deploy the transformative power of AI. After three years as a professor at the University of Pittsburgh, during which time she garnered a handful of “best paper” honors, she aims to build new collaborations within Northeastern’s Ethics Institute, the Institute for Experiential AI, and the Network Science Institute. Her work has been supported by DARPA, the NIH, Google, and Amazon, and her team is among the finalists of the second Amazon Alexa TaskBot Challenge. Alikhani teaches courses on AI ethics and on inclusive and equitable natural language processing. She also co-chairs the ethics team for the Association for Computational Linguistics’ rolling review and is a member of Northeastern’s Natural Language Processing Research Group.

The thesis of this project is that one can obtain the best of both worlds — performance evaluations with the quality of experts but at the cost of crowd workers — by optimally leveraging both experts and crowd workers in asking the “right” assessor the “right” question at the “right” time. For example, one might ask inexpensive crowd workers what are likely to be “easy” questions while reserving what are likely to be “hard” questions for the expensive experts. While the project focuses on the performance evaluation of search engines as its use case, the techniques developed will be more broadly applicable to many domains where one wishes to efficiently and effectively harness experts and crowd workers with disparate levels of cost and expertise.",Javed Aslam,Javed Aslam,,

Yet, our ability to bring these diverse literary traditions into the digital realm has been repeatedly frustrated by the underperformance of the currently available OCR solutions for Arabic-script languages. On top of this poor performance, several of them are also prohibitively expensive for academic users and offer limited trainability. For this reason, by late 2016 OpenITI’s work increasingly began to focus on the development of improved open-source OCR for Persian and Arabic through a collaboration with Benjamin Kiessling, then a computer scientist at Leipzig University’s (LU) Alexander von Humboldt Chair for Digital Humanities (now at Université Paris Sciences et Lettres). This collaboration led to a series of studies on Kiessling’s new OCR engine, Kraken, which demonstrated that its neural network-based approach to OCR (now implemented in Tesseract 4’s most recent release too) could routinely achieve accuracy rates on Persian and Arabic print books greater than 97% and, at times, even greater than 98%.",David Smith,Matthew Thomas Miller,,
